# QTL-analysis

The following scripts were used to identify QTL associated with powdery mildew disease resistance in the strawberry bi-parental mapping populations ‘Redgauntlet’ x ‘Hapil’ and ‘Emily’ x ‘Fenella’. Please follow the scripts in the following order in order to repeat the analysis. The majority of processes have been automated however the removal of shared markers was conducted as detailed in step 11 of the analysis as detailed below.

1. Calculation of AUDPC 

2. Calculation of BLUP

3. Mean of AUDPC 

4. Create doc file ExF & RxH

5. H2 Calculation 

6. GxE analysis

7. Selection validation populations segregating markers 

8. Kruskal Wallis analysis- QTL determination

9. Multiple test correction- permutation test

10. Manhatten plots

11. Correlation of phenotyping events

12. Selection of focal SNPs

13. De-selection of hk markers where appropriate 
This was done manually though referring to the manhattan plots. Shared marker peaks were assessed and included in subsequent analysis if corresponding locations saw segregation in both parents or in neither parent. 

14. Stepwise AIC selection

15. QTL plotting on consensus map

16. Validation of markers

17. Screen for interactions

18. Identify QTL & R gene cross over
